## Download

Please visit [the website for the Isaac Racing Mods](https://zamiell.github.io/isaac-racing-mods/).

<br />

## What Is It?

* This is a mod that gives racers the same starting item. The idea is that it is a compromise between seeded and unseeded racing.
* Other than that, it uses the same files as [the Jud6s mod](https://github.com/Zamiell/jud6s).
* It includes the 19 best starting items from item rooms. It also provides the option to use [other starts](https://github.com/Zamiell/instant-start-mod/blob/master/otherFiles/builds.xml), like Maw of the Void, Sacred Heart, and others.

<br />

## Rules

You are not allowed to take the item from the Basement 1 Treasure Room. (The idea of the mod is to eliminate resetting over and over. Without this rule, it would still be a good idea to reset for a *second* starting item.)

<br />
