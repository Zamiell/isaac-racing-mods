## What Is It?

Diversity Mod gives the D6 and 3 random passive items to all characters. It allows for more diversity when racing.

<br />

## Mod Changes

* All characters start with the D6 (except for Eve, Eden, and Keeper, as it isn't possible).
* All characters start with the same 3 additional random passive items, keeping their original passive items and resources.
* All special items are no longer special (to promote item diversity).
* Some items are removed from all pools; see below.
* Room modifications, animations, and bug fixes are taken from [the Jud6s mod](https://github.com/Zamiell/jud6s).

<br />

## Excluded Starting Items

Some items hardly have an effect on the playstyle of the run. Thus, it is not possible to start with the following items:

* 15 - <3
* 16 - Raw Liver
* 22 - Lunch
* 23 - Dinner
* 24 - Dessert
* 25 - Breakfast
* 26 - Rotten Meat
* 29 - Moms Underwear
* 30 - Moms Heels
* 31 - Moms Lipstick
* 92 - Super Bandage
* 119 - Blood Bag
* 176 - Stem Cells
* 194 - Magic 8 Ball
* 226 - Black Lotus
* 238 - Key Piece #1
* 239 - Key Piece #2
* 253 - Magic Scab
* 258 - Missing No.
* 334 - The Body
* 339 - Safety Pin
* 344 - Match Book
* 346 - A Snack
* 355 - Mom's Pearls
* 428 - PJs

<br />

## Item Bans

One of the goals of Diversity Mod is to force the player to play with non-standard items (such as Tiny Planet, for example). However, certain powerful items simply override tear effects, spoiling the fun. Thus, the following items are removed from all item pools:

* Mom's Knife
* Epic Fetus
* Tech X

Note that it is still possible to start with these items as one of the 3 passive items.

Furthermore, certain activated items allow you to re-roll your build. Again, this spoils the fun, as the intent is to force the player to play with non-standard items. Thus, the following items are removed from all item pools:

* D4
* D100

<br />

## Item Synergy Bans

In the context of a 1v1 match, certain item synergies are so powerful that they result in a "free" win most of the time. Thus, certain synergies are banned to make the mod more competitive in tournament play.

* If starting Soy Milk or Libra, Soy Milk and Libra are removed from all pools.
* If starting Isaac's Heart, Blood Rights are removed from all pools.
* If starting Ipecac or Dr. Fetus, Ipecac and Dr. Fetus are removed from all pools.
* If starting Monstro's Lung, Ipecac is removed from all pools.
