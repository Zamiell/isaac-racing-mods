You do not have to move any files or uninstall other mods.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## What Exactly Does the Program Do Behind the Scenes?\r\n\r\n* When the program is started, any important files in your \"resources\" directory are backed up to \"resources_tmp##########\" (a directory name corresponding to the current time).\r\n* Once you select the mod you want to play, it moves files into your \"resources\" directory and automatically starts Isaac.\r\n* When closed, the program will put everything in your \"resources\" directory back to the way it was.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Jud6s Custom Rulesets\r\n\r\nYou can find the documentation for the \"Normal / Unseeded\" ruleset on [the GitHub page for the Jud6s Mod](https://github.com/Zamiell/jud6s). Occasionally, other modified rulesets are used for racing:\r\n\r\n#### Extra Changes in the \"Seeded\" ruleset\r\n* All characters start with The Compass in addition to their other items.\r\n* Angel statues are replaced with either Uriel or Gabriel. Key Piece 1 has been placed in each Angel Room.\r\n* Pandora's Box, Teleport!, Undefined, and Book of Sin are removed from all item pools.\r\n* The Cain's Eye trinket is removed from the game.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Changes in the \"Seeded+\" ruleset\r\n* The changes from the \"Seeded\" ruleset are included in this ruleset.\r\n* The [shop pool is heavily modified](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-mods/blob/master/README-seeded+.md).\r\n\r\n#### Extra Changes in the \"Dark Room\" ruleset\r\n* 4 golden chests will now spawn at the beginning of the Dark Room (instead of red chests).\r\n* We Need To Go Deeper! is removed from all item pools.\r\n* There are special graphics for The Polaroid, The Negative, and the beam of light that takes you to the Cathedral.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Changes in \"The Lost Child Open Loser's Bracket\" ruleset\r\n* The changes from the \"Dark Room\" ruleset are included in this ruleset.\r\n* Judas starts with Judas' Shadow in addition to his other items.\r\n* Judas starts with 0 health.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Changes in the \"Mega Satan\" ruleset\r\n* Pedestals for Key Piece 1 and Key Piece 2 are placed next to the Mega Satan door.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Changes in the \"Beginner\" ruleset\r\n* Judas starts with 1 red heart and 1 full soul heart instead of of 1 red heart and 1 half soul heart.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Changes in the \"Don't Stop\" ruleset\r\n* A soul heart appears at the beginning of every floor.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Changes in the \"Pageant Boy\" ruleset\r\n* Judas starts with Cricket's Head, There's Options, and More Options in addition to the D6.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n* If the program closes unexpectedly, it can leave mod files installed. To fix this and go back to a \"vanilla\" game, delete all of the files and folders in the Isaac \"resources\" directory except for the \"packed\" directory. (By default, the \"resources\" directory is located at `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\\resources`.)\r\n* There are no release versions for OS X or Linux. However, the program is written in Python 3.4 and is cross-platform. If you have the technical know how, you can just download the source code and run the Python script directly (see below).\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Running from Source\r\n\r\n* `python --version` (to confirm that you are using Python 3.x)\r\n* `pip install psutil`\r\n* `pip install pillow`\r\n* `cd isaac-racing-mods/program`\r\n* `nano ../options.ini` (set `isaac_resources_directory` equal to your resources directory)\r\n* `python program.py` (`program.py` is the actual program and `isaac-racing-mods.py` is the automatic updater)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Building from Source\r\n\r\n(This is only tested on Windows.)\r\n\r\n* `python --version` (to confirm that you are using Python 3.x)\r\n* `pip install pyinstaller`\r\n* `cd isaac-racing-mods`\r\n* `python build.py` (will make a subdirectory called `release`)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n## Version History\r\n\r\n* *3.3.1* - August 26th\r\n  * Added the files from the Jud6s Mod v1.31. (Only a \"config.ini\" change. If you use a \"config.ini\" file, you might want to check the values of \"EnableColorCorrection\" and \"EnableFilter\" to ensure they are correct.)\r\n  * Fixed a typo in the Pageant Boy tournament ruleset menu screen.\r\n* *3.3.0* - August 25th\r\n  * Added an \"Exit\" button to the main menu.\r\n  * Added a \"Miscellaneous Stuff\" button to the main menu that contains 3 new features:\r\n    * A button to open the Isaac game directory.\r\n    * A button to open the Isaac directory in \"Documents\".\r\n    * A button to remove all currently installed mods.\r\n* *3.2.6* - August 21st\r\n  * Fixed the Diversity Mod display bug with A Dollar, A Quarter, and Money = Power in the starting room.\r\n* *3.2.5* - August 20th\r\n  * Added the files from the Jud6s Mod v1.30.\r\n* *3.2.4* - August 19th\r\n  * Added the files from the Jud6s Mod v1.29.\r\n  * Fixed the Instant Start Mod to also give the instant start item to Eve, Eden, and Keeper.\r\n* *3.2.3* - August 1st\r\n  * The \"Pageant Boy\" ruleset has been added to the choices in the Jud6s Mod menu to accommodate the upcoming tournament.\r\n* *3.2.2* - July 26th\r\n  * Added the files from the Jud6s Mod v1.28.\r\n  * The Diversity Mod items are now also given to Keeper.\r\n  * \"isaac-racing-mods-without-updater.zip\" is renamed to \"isaac-racing-mods-patch-package.zip\" to prevent confusion with new users.\r\n* *3.2.1* - July 21st\r\n  * Diversity Mod will now automatically capitalize the seed you enter.\r\n  * Diversity Mod has some item synergy bans removed:\r\n    * Tammy's Head is unbanned on Brimstone starts.\r\n    * Monstro's Lung and Chocolate Milk are unbanned on Monstro's Lung and Chocolate Milk starts.\r\n    * Ipecac is unbanned on Technology 2 starts.\r\n* *3.2.0* - June 27th\r\n  * The automatic updater now has the ability to update itself, instead of just the main program.\r\n  * Automatic updates should be twice as fast now, since the new updater is more efficient with what it downloads.\r\n  * Before launching the game, the program will sleep for 0.5 seconds to try and prevent the bug where the mod only gets partially installed.\r\n  * Added the files from the Jud6s Mod v1.27.\r\n  * The Broken Remote has been removed from the seeded ruleset.\r\n  * A new \"[Seeded+](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-mods/blob/master/README-seeded+.md)\" ruleset has been added to the Instant Start mod. This contains a modified shop pool in addition to all of the other changes in the normal seeded ruleset.\r\n  * On the Instant Start Mod, the custom starts section is now split up between custom starts with a D6 and custom starts without a D6.\r\n* *3.1.1* - June 5th\r\n  * The \"Don't Stop\" Jud6s ruleset should work properly now.\r\n* *3.1.0* - June 4th\r\n  * Added the files from the Jud6s Mod v1.26.\r\n  * Added a 7th option to the Jud6s launcher for \"Beginners\", which is the ruleset used in the Basement series of tournaments.\r\n  * Added an 8th option to the Jud6s launcher for \"Don't Stop\", which is the ruleset used in one of the legs of the Real Platinum Rod relay event.\r\n  * The mod will now permanently remember the location that you put the window. It will also work properly with multiple monitors.\r\n  * When automatically updating, the window will no longer lock up and there is a new amazing animation.\r\n  * When cleaning up after itself, the mod will now delete the config.ini file out of the resources folder if it wasn't there initially.\r\n  * Diversity Mod will no longer remove any items that you happen to start with.\r\n  * Eden now starts with 3 random items in Diversity Mod.\r\n  * Removed the \"go back\" keyboard shortcut from Diversity Mod.\r\n  * Fixed a crash with loading Diversity Mod fonts on OS X.\r\n  * Fixed a crash when launching Isaac on OS X.\r\n* *3.0.1* - May 28th, 2016\r\n  * Fixed the bug with setting a custom Isaac resources folder location.\r\n* *3.0.0* - May 28th, 2016\r\n  * This is the first version of the combined mod package. It starts at version 3.0.0 to signify that it is a subsequent version of v2.3.3, the final standalone release of Diversity Mod.\r\n  * The standalone versions of Instant Start Mod and Diversity Mod will no longer be maintained. For now, the standalone version of Jud6s will continue to be maintained alongside this one.\r\n  * The Isaac Racing Mods will now automatically update if there is a new version (provided that you click the \"Automatically update and launch the new version\" button).\r\n  * A new spiffy Jud6s launcher is added to the mod package.\r\n  * A new Mega Satan mode is added to the Instant Start Mod.\r\n  * Diversity Mod now shows the starting items and item bans on the starting room graphic, similar to what Instant Start mod does.\r\n  * Lots of changes were done behind the scenes to clean up the code.\r\n",
